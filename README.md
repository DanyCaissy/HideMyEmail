HideMyEmail
============

This is a small tool that creates a minified URL to hide the email address from spammers, it is very simple to use, you can just try it out on the site.

It is a small project, so it was built in PHP using the Slim framework. On the design side of things, it is built on top of Bootstrap and it uses jQuery as well as the zclip library (to allow modifying the clipboard).
